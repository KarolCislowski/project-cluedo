# Cluedo
Web app created to generate random set of 3 cards- a suspect, a weapon and a room, and reveal the mystery.

## Details
I started project by building models of all 3 types of cards using clases and constructors, after that I create instances of them and push to arrays- Decks of cards. Random function choose 1 card from every deck and then they are rendered covered on page. User can flip cards by clicking on them and reveal the mystery.
